# Data-development
Create a basic database for a library (by following certain business rules) and use SQL to fulfill the requirements. The universityâ€™s library wanted to commission a database for recording their books, the authors, the users, and the loans. The specifications for the tables in the database had to match a specific ERD, and they had to include factors like the right table name, datatypes, constraints, defaults, integrity, and case. In addition, successfully complete 39 queries that take into account the database.
